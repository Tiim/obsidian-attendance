**âš  This plugin is still in early stages of development, expect some bugs and make sure to backup your vault regularly!**

## How to use this plugin

Create a code block with the `attendance` type:

````
```attendance
date: 2022-03-26
title: History Class
query: #person
```
````

The `date`, `title` and `query` fields are all required.

### The date field
*currently unused*

The date field lets you specify the date of the event you want to take attendance for. This field is currently unused, but will be used in the future for exporting attendance lists.

### The title field
*currently unused*

The title field lets you specify the title of the event. This field is currently unused but will be used in the future to allow exporting only certain events. This could for example be set to a specific class name if you are taking attendance for a class.

### The query field

The query field lets you specify what notes are considered possible attendees of the event. The list will include all notes that match the query field. Currently the only query type supported are tag queries.

In the future more query types will be implemented to match the [dataview sources](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/query/sources/).

### Saving the attendance state

When you click on one of the three buttons ("present", "absent", "excused"), the codeblock behind the list will be modified to save the attendance state that you selected. The following shows an example of a codeblock with one present and one excused attendee:

````
```attendance
date: 2022-03-26
title: History Class
query: #person
* [[Ray M. Smart.md]], "present", ""
* [[Winona Philpott.md]], "excused", ""
```
````
